To pull up the terminal, if you are in VSCode press 
"ctrl+`" You will see some tabs such as PROBLEMS, OUTPUT, or TERMINAL. Make sure you are in the TERMINAL tab.

To install the dependencies needed to run the project:
1. Make sure you have a version of npm make sure you have Node installed from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 Here is a tutorial: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm 
2. run npm install

To run the code start the server by typing in the console
npm run dev 

and go to  http://localhost:3000
(you might need to wait about 20 seconds and refresh the page before you see the server pop up)

There will be text in the console with details about what is going on in the local server that is useful for debugging.

"ctrl+C" twice. Make sure you click onto the console first or else VSCode will think you are just copying something.
